## Group Information

Our research group is dedicated to interdisciplinary research in computer science, 
analytical chemistry, and chemical biology. Using chemometrics and chemoinformatics 
as the main tools and metabolomics as the starting point, we develop a series of new 
algorithms and technologies for data analysis in complex systems analysis, focusing 
on the core scientific problem of predicting unknown small molecule structures and 
functions in complex systems.
